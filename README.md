# Giraffe

A React-based visualization library powering the data visualizations in the [InfluxDB 2.0](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/) UI.

(_This library is currently in pre-beta._)

## ðŸ¦’ Features

There are plenty of terrific visualization libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem.
Giraffe aims to distinguish itself with several features:

- Support for the [Flux](https://www.influxdata.com/products/flux) language
- Easy reactivity and extensibility via React
- Support for mapping groupings of columns to a single visual aesthetic
- A high-level [Grammar of Graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf)â€“style API that can specify a wide variety of visualizations with a few simple concepts
- A [columnar](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/manipulating-flat-arrays) interface for input data that enables efficient interoperability with Web Workers and [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)
- Self-contained configurations in the style of [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
