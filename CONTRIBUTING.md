## Development

This repo contains multiple JavaScript packages linked together by [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) (i.e. it is a _monorepo_).
The source code for the library published to npm as `@influxdata/giraffe` is contained in the `giraffe` workspace.

### Developing Giraffe with Storybook

The `stories` workspace in this repository contains a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) application, which is convenient place to test changes to Giraffe.

To run the Storybook during development:

1. In a terminal, change into the `stories` workspace and run `yarn start`.
   This will start a Storybook development server.

1. Visit [http://localhost:50000](http://localhost:50000) to see the storybook.
   Changes made either in the library source or in the stories source will be reflected automatically at that URL.

### Linting & Formatting

To run linting, change into either `/giraffe` or `/stories` and run:

```
yarn lint
```

To run formatting, which uses [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier), change into either `/giraffe` or `/stories` and run:

```
yarn prettier --fix
```

To see the formatting issues without fixing, run the above without the `--fix` option

### Unit tests

To run unit tests, change into the `/giraffe` or `/stories` and run:

```
yarn test
```
